      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Greetings Mr. Scheulov!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We greatly appreciate your interest in 
      Cybertown and the opportunity to explore the possibilities of a virtual 
      campus.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are pleased to present to you a vision 
      of how a campus could successfully be implemented within our city.</font></p>

      <hr>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably the best way to go about 
      implementing this would be to install the campus as one of our colonies, 
      which traditionally provide housing and themed content to residents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Campus Colony would do all of these 
      things, and more.&nbsp; It would exist both in 2D and 3DVR.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 3D, we would have a main campus, where 
      users can walk up and down the streets and walk by various buildings and 
      campus landmarks and educational facilities.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here are some possible buildings that we may 
      want to construct, and we can break them down as much as needed.&nbsp; It 
      may suffice to have a building for all engineering programs, one for 
      science, etc.&nbsp; We may also want to have buildings for separate 
      programs.&nbsp; Some examples are shown for the first few schools.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would probably be best to divide the 
      colony into separate schools.&nbsp; Therefore in Cybertown terminology, we 
      could have a Science Neighborhood, Engineering Neighborhood, etc.&nbsp; If 
      you are not familiar with our residential structure, neighborhoods divide 
      up the major colony theme into more in-depth sections.&nbsp; Our 
      engineering neighborhood would simply represent the part of campus with 
      the engineering facilities and student housing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Neighborhoods could contain their own 3D 
      worlds, just as the colony itself does.&nbsp; One possibility is to make 
      the interiors of certain buildings of the main campus world act as worlds 
      for the different neighborhoods.&nbsp; Thus, as a citizen walks around the 
      main campus, they can enter the Engineering Building and would then have 
      access to the 3D interior and the 2D content and resources that would be 
      provided by the Engineering Neighborhood and could go on from there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today, Cybertown neighborhoods are 
      divided up into city blocks that contain housing space for residents.&nbsp; 
      To create a more immersive and useful environment, we have done some 
      research into creating city blocks for purposes other than housing.&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Below lies a snapshot of a typical 
      Cybertown neighborhood:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/hoodex.jpg" width="352" height="195"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What we would like to do for the Campus 
      is to create blocks for traditional housing purposes, as well as to 
      accommodate other features such as individual educational buildings and 
      commercial areas and shops that can be purchased or leased by other 
      sponsors.&nbsp; Below is an incomplete, and lower quality testing version 
      of a neighborhood map that shows how 
      blocks of the future may be assembled:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/hoodng.jpg" width="540" height="300"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Residential blocks would provide spaces 
      for students to build their houses and be close by to the educational 
      content they need.&nbsp;They would be exactly like the blocks currently 
      available in Cybertown today.&nbsp; Instructional buildings like the Electrical 
      Engineering Building (shown above) could possibly contain a 3D world and 
      other resources that would be applicable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this type of system, Universities that 
      you serve could possibly have multiple blocks and locations around the 
      campus.&nbsp; For example, the University of Phoenix could have buildings 
      and housing areas in multiple neighborhoods, rather than have a 
      neighborhood of their own.&nbsp; By dividing the colony in this fashion, 
      users can be exposed to the many different options available to them for 
      each particular field of study.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many resources, including links, 
      tutorials, information, and even advertisements can be made accessible via 
      the standard 2d utilities that are integrated into the colonies.&nbsp; 
      Custom links can also be integrated to provide easy access to the websites 
      that we are wanting them to find and visit!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Customized interfaces in 2D can also be 
      installed to give the colony a unique and well integrated look.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If we want to add some extra content, we 
      could add buildings that offer free training that citizens may find of 
      interest.&nbsp; Popular choices may be skills and technologies that can 
      help them in Cybertown, including:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">HTML/Web Development</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">VRML, World Building and Architecture</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imaging</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Macromedia Flash Development</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of our upcoming neighborhoods in the 
      Hi-Tek Colony, Origins, will offer tutorials and information about the 
      fundamentals of a high-tech career as well as some basic learning 
      materials for fields such as electrical engineering and computer science.&nbsp; 
      Some examples of possible resources are:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tutorials in various levels of Math, 
        Chemistry, Physics, Biology</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tutorials and walkthroughs of fun 
        projects that deal with various fields, including Electrical 
        Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Technology, or anything that 
        other skilled citizens can contribute.&nbsp; </font></li>
      </ul>
