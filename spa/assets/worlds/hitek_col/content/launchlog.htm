welcome everyone to the grand opening of Hi-Tek <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Thanks Ck <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : I'm &quot;Stuff&quot; lol <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : This is an exciting day for Cybertown :) <br>
[Security Commissioner] Oherra [19940] : Thanks CK <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Hi O :-) <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : hehe, my places list hasn't caught up with 
itself yet <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Hi-Tek brings not only a new colony with a new 
theme, but some exciting new &quot;bells and whistles&quot; as well <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : I'm sure our techs will be happy to give everyone 
all the info on exactly what Hi-Tek contains <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : :-) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : A special thanks go to Hawk for allowing this 
colony to open <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : and to the designers and the techs who worked so 
hard on getting it up and ready. <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : *clap clap clap!* <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : I'm sure everyone is just wondering who the new 
CL of this colony will be :) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : It is with great pleasure that we add not only a 
new colony leader, but a new council member to the team <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : May I present you all with your new CL.... <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Halogen :))))) <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Congratulations!!!! <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : *whistling and foot stomping* !!! 
Congratulations Hal! <br>
[Security Commissioner] Oherra [19940] : Congratulations Halogen! <br>

[Neighborhood Deputy] Favercoal [1705] : *clap*clap*clap* <br>
[Colony_Deputy] editme [12320] : WTG HAL <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] Praeses1ga [9067] : congrats <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thank you very much! :) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : I'd like to turn the floor over to Halogen 
now...speech speech :))) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thanks so much! ;) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Can anyone hear me?????? <br>
[Club Assistant] kilted_crusader [2601] : come on kamma post my appreciation or 
people will think im a dope <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : I can hear you :) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : I can :o) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : This is very surreal for me, very difficult to 
believe this day is actually here. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Today, my greatest Cybertown adventure, the 
multi-year development of Hi-Tek, takes a new turn. Also today, many of you will 
begin your greatest Cybertown adventure: a career or residence in Hi-Tek. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : I would like to start off with a startling fact:
<br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Over one half of all the knowledge accumulated by 
man was acquired in the last 75 years. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Say it all you want, it amazes me every time. <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : wow <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : If you think the past ten years have been an 
amazing ride with technology, just imagine what is possible in the next 5 
years!! What about 10 - 25 -- even 50 years? I really can't imagine what is 
headed our way in the next couple of years let alone the next decade. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : If the trend of knowledge acquisition continues, 
it would be a safe bet that by 2040, our level of technology will have doubled 
once again. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Some exciting predictions! However, take these 
predictions with a grain of salt, because that's all they are - just 
predictions. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : To give you an idea of how naïve some of our 
predictions may be, here is an interesting prediction made in the March 1949 
issue of Popular Mechanics, talking about the new ENIAC computer: <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Where the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum 
tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may have 1,000 vacuum tubes 
and perhaps weigh just 1.5 tons.<br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : LOL <br>
[Security Commissioner] Oherra [19940] : heh <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : :o) <br>
[Templar] BorgQueen [15503] : gotta love 'our' technology eh? *smirk* <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Imagine what our world will be like when history 
repeats itself, and those 10 GHz computers sound as ludicrous and ancient as 
those 1.5 ton computers. That day will come, and probably sooner than we think.
<br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : This excitement is the very essence of Hi-Tek. 
Our mission is to provide you the most comprehensive technology portal for 
information, resources, and news as we watch this amazing century unfold. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Just as important, however, is a potentially 
greater mission - to make our young people ready. There are some amazing 
opportunities in store for them in school, college, and in their career. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : At the heart of this mission lies a very special 
neighborhood right in the center of our colony, Origins. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Not only will Hi-Tek provide information about 
the latest technologies from a variety of fields, we will also be shifting the 
entire spectrum of content in Cybertown to include extremely valuable 
educational resources for residents of not only Hi-Tek but the entire city. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : This will help prepare those who are interested 
in a career dealing with science, engineering or fields showcased by our 
neighborhoods. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : That is why I have proposed a citywide team of 
content creators, who will come from all walks of life with different levels and 
kinds of expertise, to create free tutorials, lessons, and demonstrations in the 
foundational subjects that are crucial to a successful high-tech career. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : These will range from Mathematics, Physics, 
Computer Science, Chemistry, and many varieties of Engineering. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Hi-Tek will make sure you find the information 
you need, and our Colony Mentors, many of which will be students in higher 
education themselves, will provide free homework help for those who want it. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Just because you are a young person does not mean 
you are left out of the worldwide force that will help to increase technology 
and science. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : By assisting you and helping you to prepare for 
college, (sometimes by even teaching you college level material), Hi-Tek can 
also help to increase technology by allowing you to maximize your potential so 
each and every one of you change the world in a positive and amazing way. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : I would now like to give you a small tour of what 
you will see in the colony. Let's start at the colony level. Our colony logo 
consists of two moons joined together to form a flying eagle, symbolizing 
freedom and a flight into the future. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Our 3D plaza, or Starport, which is modeled after 
the famous 4 ringed building on the City Map, stands 2000 virtual meters high. 
From there you can &quot;launch&quot; off to any of Hi-Tek's various neighborhoods. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : We have managed to create two complete Starports 
but, as much as we love it the current one, the future of it is uncertain, as a 
new, third Starport has begun construction! <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : We have 16 neighborhoods; four that are opening 
now: (Computing, The Odyssey, Med-Tek, and Horizons) You can view a description 
of all the neighborhoods by clicking &quot;Immigration&quot; on Hi-Tek Today. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Our block maps provide a bird's eye view of a 
beautiful, Cybertown cityscape modeled after Cybertown NG concepts. You will see 
a beautiful array of 2D homes that will dazzle the eye and add an amazing new 
atmosphere to the blocks. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Residents of Hi-Tek will find real life resources 
on every block message board that provides information about the block topic, 
and all public boards feature our website, Hi-Tek Today, which is a daily news 
hub for technology and colony news. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Though it is a mere static image, I have big 
plans of improving it, and those upgrades are well on the way. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : We have also constructed some beautiful new 
homes. The ones available now were made by Toxic_Terry, zoozee, and IsTLionK. 
More from Escort, qbertrocks and Brand_Of_On are on the way, as soon as we wrap 
up the texturing. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : We are currently working on many new houses to 
add to our existing ones. You can see some of the new houses by clicking on the 
&quot;Housing&quot; link on Hi-Tek Today. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : I promise to all of our colonists an exciting, 
vibrant, ever-changing and improving colony that will show you a little bit of 
the future each and every day. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : There are many people to thank today. Members of 
our Strategic Plan Development Committee, DevTeam, and fellow neighbors helped 
in the planning of the operation of the colony, and constructing 3D worlds. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : These generous people are: <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : arkducky <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : JeetKuneDo <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Brand_Of_On <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Toxic_Terry <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Robin <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Escort <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Golf_Prodigy <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : zoundite<br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : CyberAngel2000 <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : anilover <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : zoozee <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : IsTLionK <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : and qbertrocks <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : I thank all of these generous people, as well as 
Simioni &amp; Coolkama for their outstanding installation work. They have done much 
more than I ever thought possible, and Hi-Tek would not be what it is without 
them. It certainly wouldn't be standing today. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : A would also like to thank all people who have 
graciously expressed their support and excitement on our Message Board here. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Your comments have made all these years very 
worthwhile, and I certainly hope you enjoy what we have to offer, whether you 
live here or not. <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Also, undoubtedly, one of our greatest supporters 
over the years on this project is our own Founder, Hawk!! We are forever in his 
debt, as Hi-Tek may have never seen the light of day without his faith in what 
we set out to accomplish. <br>
[Block Leader] ctchris [1228] : *goes wild * yea you rule <br>
[Club Assistant] kilted_crusader [2601] : Halogen is CL <br>
[Theatre Deputy] CyberBrian [21056] : I know I'll greatly be helped by this :)
<br>
XxMiss_PerfectxX [3557] : @_@ <br>
ZONE25 [110] : ZONE25 smiles at everyone <br>
[Theatre Deputy] CyberBrian [21056] : Way to go Hi-Tek! <br>
[Theatre Deputy] CyberBrian [21056] : WTG Hawk! <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : :) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : awesome.... I'm beyond impressed! <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : clapclapclap <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : :-) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : wonderful speech :) <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : ah, I can see you now Jo :-) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : and now..a few words from our Founder? :))) <br>
Coolkama : (wow mod is hard! lol) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : lol yes it is :) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thank you very much :) <br>
[Colony Deputy] TomanCreed [22624] : *clap clap clap clap clap* <br>
Coolkama : hawk say something if you here? <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Hawk, are you still with us? <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : who kidnapped our founder? :) <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : lol <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : it's hard to type when you have a twinkie in 
each hand :) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : ahh...that must be it!! <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : while we let hawk finish his twinkies :)) 
Simioni.... <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : would you like to say a few words? <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Thanks Jo...now for the boring bit :o) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : possibly that 1 ton laptop is slowing Hawk down 
:) <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : What you see today has been over a month of 
installation work, and 3 years of planning. This colony has been made BY the 
citizens FOR the citizens and I feel that is what makes it so unique as a 
colony. <br>
Coolkama : ...: hello <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : Has anyone heard whatI said so far???? <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : hawk! I see that now <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : no Hawk LOL <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : that is all I have seen :( <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : just what you just typed <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : yes now that i see - that one line :) <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : yikes -I'll send it again then <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : want me to finish after you Hawk? <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : wonderful :))) <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : Hello. Sorry I couldn't answer all your PCs or whispers 
- there were simply way too may of them! Plus most of them had no names attached 
so I had no idea who they were from :( <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : please simi, yes <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : k <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : Over the past many months, years even, I have watched 
Halogen take his dream of a Hi-Tek Colony from ideas on paper to a full-blown, 
fully designed and operational Colony. <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : As both Halogen and Simioni can attest, opening a new 
Colony requires an enormous amount of design, graphics and programming work and 
one of the things that has been very gratifying to me personally (my current 
schedule and activities being what they are) is that a great deal of the design 
work and programming has also been done by Halogen himself and his team, with a 
lot of recent help from Simioni and Coolkama. And they've done a stellar job.
<br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : I'm very proud to be associated with fine people such 
as these and I wish this new Colony all the success that it will undoubtedly 
achieve. With regard to my current schedule and activities and the recent 
results obtained for CT, there'll be a rather major announcement soon :) <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : Thank you. <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : *applause* <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Thank you Hawk :))) <br>
[Security Commissioner] Oherra [19940] : clap clap <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thank you very much, sir! That certainly means a 
lot :) <br>
Coolkama : smile <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : :-) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Simi :) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : stellar.... true <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : ok, my people list has died, but here it comes 
:-) <br>
[Founder] Hawk [57296] : (buried under PCs and whispers from anonymous people)
<br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : lol <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : What you see today has been over a month of 
installation work, and 3 years of planning. This colony has been made BY the 
citizens FOR the citizens and I feel that is what makes it so unique as a 
colony. <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Before I go on to talk about some of the 
special features of the colony, I would first like to thank some people and 
acknowledge them, without their work and determination, there would be no Hi-Tek. 
Coolkama, for his superb work on Hi-Tek's housing level code, <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : without him, you would not be enjoying all the 
superb new homes working. Halogen, for his tremendous work on the materials for 
this colony, he has produced everything I have asked for within hours of my 
requests, that shows the sheer amount of dedication he has to Cybertown. <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Also, a BIG thank you to the 3D developers who 
worked so professionally on this colony's material. Toxic_Terry in particular 
has shown once again his true talents with VRML. And to anyone who created 
something but I've missed, thank you also! <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Now to mention two of the special features you 
can expect from Hi-Tek. All message boards in the colony will display Hi-Tek 
today, with colony news and links to resources that are now at the click of a 
button, wherever you are in the colony. This means that colony news will get 
delivered to every resident, all the time. This is even greater because it 
doesn't take up any of your configuration space! <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : You will also have a choice of 7, yes 7! 
customised 3D Homes, exclusive to Hi-Tek only. You won't have to pay too much 
for them because they are all conveniently priced within the same range as other 
colonies. <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : And of course, who could forget the customised 
right hand frame and cool look that the colony and your 2D homes will have. It 
definitely gives your home the Hi-Tek look! <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : I hope you all enjoy your stay here! Its been 
really great to have worked with the development of this, Cybertown's newest 
colony! <br>
[City Council] Simioni [22395] : Thank you all <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Thank you simi :)))) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thanks very much once again Simioni :) <br>
[Security Commissioner] Oherra [19940] : clapps &quot;) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : Applause!.... very good! :) <br>
Coolkama : woohoo! <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : *whistles* <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : There is more where that came from too! :) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : such great work from everyone..it shows just how 
well a team can work together and have positive results :)) <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : very True Ms Mayor <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : Jason_RC ..I believe you have a few words for us 
as well? <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : vi..did you give jason twinkies too?? <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : LOL no, but I think I left the truck door open
<br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : are my words appearing? <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : now they are Jason <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : now they are Jason :) <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : you need to start again <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : yep! :) <br>
[Club Assistant] Jovinlim89 [4013] : clap clap clap <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : am I viewable now? <br>
[City Advisor] Vialle [30428] : yep <br>
Coolkama : yep jason got ya! heh <br>
[City Mayor] Jolinth [21187] : yes..we can hear you now :) <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : ok...I will try to be brief...I tend to talk a 
lot so just throw something at me if I go on too long <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : It is wonderful to see such an amazing turnout 
here for today's event. A lot of people have been waiting a long time for today 
to take place. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : I am proud to be here are the opening and birth 
of our newest colony. I wish nothing but success to Hi-Tek and look forward to 
the renewed energy and vitality its creation will bring to our community... <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : I know some people have expressed concern about 
the opening of a new colony. Some feel that it should not be opened without 
first filling existing ones. People are entitled to have that opinion, we are 
all individuals with our own viewpoints, and now and again opinion differs...
<br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : As a community we all want what is best for 
Cybertown, which is to see the place prosper and grow and to embrace more 
members allowing us all to make more friends and have more fun. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : Diversity and choice for the residents is key to 
attracting more people to our community. New places with more themes, new ideas 
and new content all compliment and aid our community in its growth. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : The excitement generated by launches such as 
this, the anticipation and thrill of being able to witness its birth, the 
opportunities it offers all stand us in good stead for the future. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : It has a remarkable concept and promises to be 
not only a wonderful home to its residents, but a fun place to grow knowledge 
relating to matters on the cutting edge of technology. As Halogen outlined, the 
concept is truly amazing and will be of great benefit to people all over our 
community. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : As Hawk, Halogen and Simioni have outlined so 
well, it has taken the efforts of some wonderful individuals working as a team 
to make that dream a reality. Well done to all who have been involved in turning 
that concept into something tangible. <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : Good luck to Halogen and his team in their new 
roles and I look forward to seeing the success of Hi-Tek and in turn the growth 
and development of Cybertown in the future :-) <br>
[Sponsor IC] Halogen [25884] : Thanks so much, Mr. Ambassador! :) <br>
[Ambassador] Jason_RC [11597] : thats me done...*wonders off and eats the 
twinkies* <br>

Cybertown's history.I believe that this new concept is a step toward a series of 
improvements within the city, and I have only excitement to express because of 
it. With this said, congratulations to Hi-Tek colony, good luck to any 
applicants, and finally, thank you to CoolKama, Simioni, Halogen, - the Founder 
Hawk, the Caretakers, and anyone else who had worked on this excellent project.
