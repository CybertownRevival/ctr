[Colony_Deputy] Toila [5830] : you left out the &quot;not&quot; <br>

to delete are those violating the IVN/Cybertown Laws and those who say Delete Me
<br>
[City Council] arkducky [24189] : any approved deletion needs a screen shot of 
the house prior to deletion and send to me...try to save it as jpg and keep the
