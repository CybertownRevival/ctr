conclude most voters read HCS News..... <br>
[Colony Secretary] MC_Alz [8513] : However, to provide Hi-Tek with news, events 
and updates, HCS decided ( thanks to arkducky and zoundite for allowing this ) 
to once again launch a new website, which will have in-depth content <br>

will be completely cleaned of all applications after the neighborhood leaders 
for Concourse &quot;D&quot; have been appointed. <br>

[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : residents can speak and ask questions at the

[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : I would like to speak about Intelli-Tek
<br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : ok :) you may begin cyberman! <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : Intelli-Tek has only been open a short 
time, but we already have a great family of Neighborhood workers doing their job 
the best they can. We have 20 residents and I am sure the number will begin to 
get larger. <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : Also, the Neighborhood site is almost 
done, I have been working on it and I will give the address very soon to be 
posted <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : I would also like to take this time to 
thank ark_ducky for all his council and help on getting me started, he has been 
a great help to the success of Intelli-Tek. That is all <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : arkducky, sorry typo, lol <br>

[Colony Secretary] BassMekanik2000 [15948] : *claps* <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : NDs and CDs are what make things 
happen, couldn't do the job without them <br>
[Gallery Chief] Handsome109 [8586] : Meeting? lol ^_^ <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : yep! <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : any other hoods? <br>
[Gallery Chief] Handsome109 [8586] : ah ok :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : in that case, i guess its my turn <br>
[Club Owner] Bratty-Cat [1084] : whats up? <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : eep <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : Colony meeting. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Hi-Tek needs a CERB representative - it is a 
very honorable but demanding position and in my opinion a great CT career move.
<br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : If you are interested, fill out an app! There 
is a link provided at the services page which can be accessed by Hi-Tek Today/
<br>
[Neighborhood Leader] Tripod_Yeti [8854] : i would love to do that if only i was 
part of Hi-Tek <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : wow! <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : cerb requires you not to hold other jobs 
correct? <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : whast going on here!? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : thats correct <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : colony meeting <br>
[Club Owner] Bratty-Cat [1084] : cerb! oh no! *holds up a small cross* <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : Erico, it is a colony meeting <br>
[Gallery Chief] Handsome109 [8586] : also 18+ years of age :) <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : omg! <br>
[Elder] White_Archangel [11895] : yup tangy, no other job since you need to be 
impartial <br>
** <br>
Halogen : Moderation will be deactivated after I finish making some rather 
important announcements <br>
Halogen : and then i will take any questions you have <br>
Halogen : A few staff changes have taken place - Jeremy12 is now Med-Tek NL and 
will be leading it out of a large, but amateur attack on the neighborhood. <br>
Halogen : BassMekanik2000 is now going around the hood contacting NLs. He will 
be working with you to propose block/content changes within your neighborhood.
<br>
Halogen : I have not received any updates on the condition of WitchEva, but I 
will let you know as soon as I hear anything. <br>
Halogen : We are not seeking a replacement for her. <br>
Halogen : Last night, we decided on a financial system for Hi-Tek. <br>
Halogen : To save on work for IVN, we will be creating one bank account for all 
of Hi-Tek. <br>
Halogen : The colony staff will be using financial and accounting software to 
manage and keep track of what money belongs to which neighborhood. <br>
Halogen : All money acquired by hoods will be placed in this protected Hi-Tek 
bank account <br>
Halogen : The transfer of funds to those needing to use it will not be an issue
<br>
Halogen : So NLs have nothing to worry about in that regard <br>
Halogen : If you have a bank account at this time, you will not be able to 
access it tomorrow. <br>
Halogen : Therefore, you need to contact me or arkducky in order to move the 
funds. <br>
Halogen : For those who are leaving us tomorrow, I want to thank you for making 
Cybertown your home. <br>
Halogen : We will greatly miss our friends and neighbors who will not be 
staying, but we wish you the best of luck. <br>
Halogen : Due to the importance of financial stability in Cybertown and to 
possibly make it a free site once again in the future, I must realign my 
priorities. <br>
Halogen : In order to handle my Dep. Sponsors IC position, my education, and 
other Cybertown and Hi-Tek projects, I will be stepping down as CL effective 
January 13th <br>
Halogen : A new CL should be in place at that point with zero downtime. <br>
Halogen : It has been a great pleasure to be your CL, but there are others who 
can do it just as well if not better, and I will greatly need the time in order 
to ensure that my dream for Hi-Tek becomes a reality. <br>
Halogen : We are very close to it - but not quite to where I want it to be. <br>
Halogen : With the permission of the new CL, I will continue to assist 
contentwise, with the development of a new integrated web based portal, as well 
as continuing work on many new houses, Hi-Tek Today, updated block maps, and 
more. <br>
Halogen : In fact, where I now stand in the Starport is the future site of a 
very exciting expansion. <br>
Halogen : More info on that later though. <br>
Halogen : With that, we will now take any questions you might have. <br>
** chat no longer moderated ** <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : May i speak for one moment? <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : *raises hand* <br>
[Casino Chief] Undercore [11417] : *claps* <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : :-( <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : puts down* <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : Tangle was first <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Tangle, go ahead <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : go ahead erico <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : oh okay. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I moved here January 1. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : Thought, I will start out the new year in a 
brand new colony. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : :) <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : So far I have found very many people I have 
grown to respect in ct living here already. <br>
[Colony Secretary] BassMekanik2000 [15948] : :) <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : But, I have received no replies to my post on 
hood or block boards. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : And not one welcome message for this nick or my 
other one. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : In what neighborhoods are you experiencing 
this problem? <br>
[Colony Secretary] BassMekanik2000 [15948] : o.O <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I find that a bit dissappointing. SHort on 
staff I can understand, but if you want to keep your new residents, especially 
those new to CT you need to let them know they are welcome here. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I live in Enviro Tek / Terraforming <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : If I might respond to this please
<br>
[Neighborhood Leader] cyberman [10669] : I make it a very important point to 
welcome each and every person to my neighborhood, when they move there, they 
become part of my family here in CT, and they are treated all the same... just 
thought I would say that, I think all NLs should do the same <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I would point out that message board posting 
will help to boost stats for your blocks. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : we will certainly look into the quality of the 
staff at enviro-tek and I thank you for your complaint. <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : *raises hand* <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I am not trying to point fingers, I would just 
like see this place grow. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : and that brings up a very good point. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I put alot of sweat and love into my old colony 
and I would like to do the same here. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : We are now approacing 1000 residents <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : woohoo! <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : I would also like to donate 250,000 cc to your 
colony bank. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : to help. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : The staff should not take that as evidence 
that they are doing things right though. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Many of you are and I can see that. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : However the fundamental quality of a 
neighborhood and the extremely necessary actions of welcoming a resident will go 
to show what Hi-Tek does after its novelty wears off. <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : exactly <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : I will be working to bring new goodies to Hi-Tek's 
residents, but that is just icing on the cake. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : I am going to put 2 tons of icing on the cake
<br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : =D <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : lol <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : lol <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : So we need about 8 tons of fundamental good 
work :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : If that makes any sense <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : rofl <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : I hate too much icing. <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : yes it does <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : yes it does <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23552] : looks like i will have to eat a tunnel out of 
my house hahaha <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : ? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Thank you veyr much for your generosity

will miss your leadership. good luck on your future. <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : Tx wants to say something too <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : lol <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [5223] : Tx was first <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : thank you very much! <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : Second, I think we should have a 
charity for Wicheva, try to make some money for her for what she has lost while 
being in the hospital <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : sorry i cant keep track <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : Donations of the sort <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : Make her comeback a warm one. <br>

[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : perhaps a limited object could be made and sold 
in her honor the proceeds going to her. <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : ok please if I could offer something

[Sponsor Team Member] CyberAngel2000 [18963] : ::poofs in:: <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : this is no excuse but most of the 
hoods are trying to get going with organizing and hiring etc and with the 
holidays it's been chaos and with the now changing days of CT <br>
[Elder] White_Archangel [11895] : *looks at the daily officer* yup looks like im 
off to the bar down town ..... erm my bed. Enjoy the rest of the day everyone
<br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : things haven't been as organized as 
any of us would wish with brand new jobs here <br>
[Colony Secretary] BassMekanik2000 [15948] : bye white :) <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : bye wabro :) I (L) you :) <br>
[Colony Secretary] BassMekanik2000 [15948] : have fun <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : bye white <br>
[Sponsor Team Member] CyberAngel2000 [18963] : see ya wa <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [5223] : Go ahead Tx <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : and yes we should be making this an 
awesome welcome for everyone but in consideration of the holidays and changes I 
know things were kinda slow on boards etc but Tangle with a little more time I 
think you will see <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : great things happening on every 
aspect of Hi Tek <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : and I as an NL am sorry it hasn't 
lived up to what you expected and I vow that it will be better.....and want to 
offer hugs from my hood to you <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : Our staff have worked hard <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : to make it as it is today <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : just give us a bit of time to make 
it tops ....giggles <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : it's getting there <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : well... im waiting for relics to open lol.. i 
will fit in well there. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : being one. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : It wont be long :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Thanks very much for sharing Tx <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : welcome <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Undercore has a comment on this <br>
[Casino Chief] Undercore [11417] : About the hood affairs, maybe some sort of 
hood supervisor wouldn't be a bad idea. Someone to check that all hood staff are 
doing their jobs as requested? :-) <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : isnt that the Nls job? <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : yes <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : it is <br>
[Casino Chief] Undercore [11417] : yes, but in other colonies for example a CD 
looks over their NL's, here the CD's have other assignments <br>
[Neighborhood Leader] TxBornVaNow [12257] : *giggles*...ark keeps good tabs on 
me and mine lol rotfl lmao <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : Nls should be experienced enough to handle 
thier staff without a cd overlooking them constantly. <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : in most colonies, a cd is there for assistance 
if needed, not as a taskmaster. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : In theory it is up to the commander to ensure 
that hoods are operating normally - but it may be useful to put more CDs in 
charge of that to handle the 16 hoods that will soon be open. <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : Security handles a lot of &quot;hood sweeps&quot; <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : that are done in other colonies <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : so having a team to handle the other aspect of 
supervision may indeed help. <br>
[Casino Chief] Undercore [11417] : Indeed, but to your comment for example 
Tangle, if a hood's staff gets inactive without anyone noticing it 
immediately... <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Erico2000 [13982] : alot can happen <br>
[Jail Guard] TanGleBox [15685] : Im confused, you say security handles hood 
sweeps? Surely you dont mean cybertown Security. <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23552] : ahhh back :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [27448] : our Security team. <br>
