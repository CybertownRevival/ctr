<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">arkducky&gt; Alrighty...<br>
arkducky&gt; now that we are all 20 yrs older after waiting for this to<br>
load...we will start the meeting :)<br>
arkducky&gt; First on my list:<br>
arkducky&gt; If anyone has logs from the last meeting, I would appreciate it<br>
if you could send those to hitekcommander@hotmail.com<br>
arkducky&gt; These will be listed on our colony history page and in the<br>
news for future reference.<br>
arkducky&gt; Also, I have some great news!<br>
arkducky&gt; For those who may not know, WitchEva will be returning to<br>
the colony very soon!<br>
arkducky&gt; She is out of the hospital and just catching up on things she<br>
has missed while out of commission.<br>
arkducky&gt; As soon as I can find out what is preventing her from<br>
accessing Cybertown, she will get return as the Chief Events Officer for<br>
the colony!<br>
arkducky&gt; Second:<br>
arkducky&gt; All hoods are now open as of last monday. This also means<br>
that we are currently not hiring any more neighborhood leaders.<br>
arkducky&gt; I expect all neighborhood leaders work together in providing<br>
the best experience within your respective hood.<br>
arkducky&gt; Also, from the mayor's office, no more hoods or colonies will<br>
be opened until further noted.<br>
arkducky&gt; The addition of neighborhoods just joined colonies on that list,<br>
btw.<br>
arkducky&gt; With my point on my expecting all staff to work together, this<br>
leads to the next thing on my list...<br>
arkducky&gt; The Low-Density plan<br>
arkducky&gt; This is the most important thing to go in effect right now as<br>
this will allow us to provide the most content to the residents within<br>
Cybertown and also have active hoods due to the low population in the<br>
city.<br>
arkducky&gt; This will increase the likelihood of someone sponsoring<br>
Hi-Tek and thus increasing the possibility that more residents can be<br>
sponsored and thus have their fees waived.<br>
arkducky&gt; As you can see, this is very important!<br>
arkducky&gt; Here is some description of this plan:<br>
arkducky&gt; To do this, we simply open free spaces along the roads of the<br>
blocks - maybe 25 houses per block total - then thats it. We consider the<br>
block full, and we open another.<br>
arkducky&gt; With decreased density, it will be easier for NDs to take on BL<br>
positions as well if we can't find any new workers.<br>
arkducky&gt; When we hit 7-10 blocks per hood - thats it, the hood is full.<br>
arkducky&gt; If there are free spaces in a certain block and someone really<br>
wants in, we should let them in. NLs should offer this service.<br>
arkducky&gt; Please refer to Section III of the guidelines located at<br>
http://www.cybertown.com/places/hi-tek/content/guidelines.htm for the<br>
target population numbers in the hoods and in the blocks.<br>
arkducky&gt; Also, I am allowing, for those who want to, hold more than<br>
one colony job.<br>
arkducky&gt; There is one exception!<br>
arkducky&gt; If for any reason, you are unable to perform your multiple<br>
duties in the colony, I expect you to release yourself from one or more<br>
positions until you are able to perform all tasks.<br>
arkducky&gt; Otherwise, those positions will be released for you. :)<br>
arkducky&gt; I will entertain any questions about the low-density plan after I<br>
have gone through everything on my list. :)<br>
arkducky&gt; Forth:<br>
arkducky&gt; The employment desk will shortly be wiped clean!<br>
arkducky&gt; Every application that is in there will be closed and deleted.<br>
arkducky&gt; This does not effect your account in the employment desk.<br>
arkducky&gt; Just the applications placed.<br>
arkducky&gt; Also, before any one is hired, and I mean any one, an<br>
application must first be filled out in the employment desk!<br>
arkducky&gt; I will do my best in setting up each neighborhood leader an<br>
account in the employment desk to check applications.<br>
arkducky&gt; Also, I will allow each hood one neighborhood deputy to have<br>
access to assist in this hiring process.<br>
arkducky&gt; You can consider him/her your hood employment officer. :)<br>
arkducky&gt; I will also entertain any minor questions about what I have<br>
planned for the employment desk at the end as well.<br>
arkducky&gt; Last, but not least:<br>
arkducky&gt; Neighborhood websites can be placed on the<br>
http://hitek.arkducky.com website.<br>
arkducky&gt; I will have to manually upload the files since I do not feel safe<br>
allowing 17 people, including myself, have access to the colony server<br>
acct.<br>
arkducky&gt; I would highly encourage this as it centralizes the hood<br>
websites.<br>
arkducky&gt; Neighborhood leaders, contact me at<br>
hitekcommander@hotmail.com to get this setup.<br>
arkducky&gt; Now, the Q&amp;A session. Simply send your question in and I will<br>
post and answer them in the order I recieve them.<br>
arkducky&gt; receive rather.<br>
arkducky&gt; I take it everyone understood everything I said?<br>
arkducky&gt; I must be really good! hehehe :)<br>
HolodocDR&gt; It's just a coincidence about you wiping the employment<br>
desk. As a new NL I have not been given any information on accessing<br>
prospective applicants, and view their education and experience and<br>
strong/weak points for consideration. I would have liked that.<br>
arkducky&gt; A: All the applications are at most 3 months old.<br>
arkducky&gt; To ensure all applications are up to date, this is required.<br>
arkducky&gt; Contact me at my e-mail and I will setup an acct for you.<br>
tinas&gt; in my opinion there is a weak point in the low density plan: since<br>
we are not allowed to delete houses some hoods (the ones from<br>
concourse A and B) are filled up with &quot;dead&quot; houses (last login mid<br>
november, lots of 50 exp. houses etc) - thus I consider the l.d. plan to<br>
only apply for &quot;active houses&quot;, is that legitimate?<br>
arkducky&gt; Until I can find out who has paid and who hasn't and given<br>
those who havn't paid time to gather money and return, this ban will<br>
remain in effect.<br>
arkducky&gt; Hawk stated in his RAQ, that member that have paid would<br>
not have their house deleted. There currently isn't a way to detect this so<br>
I am playing it safe.<br>
HolodocDR&gt; Re hood websites. I can understand since this is a<br>
personal space. Why not have the main splash page of a hood site on<br>
yours and have it link to a site elsewhere. Make it a main portal page<br>
which people can remember or visit and it will take them to it?<br>
arkducky&gt; That has been a consideration. If you do not want to hassle<br>
with me doing all the updates, I can simply put in a redirect and do it that<br>
way.<br>
arkducky&gt; Send me an e-mail if you want either system installed.<br>
Ghost1alpha&gt; can you eplain the density plan in further detail Ark?<br>
arkducky&gt; What would you like to know? Any specific questions?<br>
arkducky&gt; Actually, I will create an online format of the low-density plan<br>
for viewing purposes.<br>
Borg7_of_9&gt; I believe it was announced at the Town meeting yesterday<br>
that we would be allowed to start doing some deletions sometime next<br>
March<br>
arkducky&gt; That will be up to each colony leader. Right now, I am not<br>
comfortable with deleting houses even if it affects the statistics and I<br>
don't have a set time to begin deleting also.<br>
arkducky&gt; It is a day-by-day basis and we are working on ways to find<br>
out who has paid or not, etc.<br>
tinas&gt; oh, dont get me wrong - not criticising the delete ban, just pointing<br>
out that its causing and disadvantage for the hoods that opened first if<br>
the l.d. plan applies to them the same way<br>
arkducky&gt; Don't worry too much about statistics but what the residents<br>
actually feel.<br>
HolodocDR&gt; regarding inactive staff (idle Jan 6 and prior). I would like to<br>
point out that although we cannot delete homes, we should be able to<br>
have titles removed from homes which are not active staff. How can this<br>
be arranged?<br>
arkducky&gt; That will involve a lot of work on the Com. Tech. team, simioni<br>
and coolkama<br>
nick_316&gt; Hood message boards. You might have talked about this but<br>
what can we do with them?<br>
arkducky&gt; Read the guidelines at<br>
http://www.cybertown.com/places/hi-tek/content/guidelines.htm<br>
arkducky&gt; Ty for the notice Maestro in my mod window. I will look into<br>
that :)<br>
arkducky&gt; A quick note:<br>
arkducky&gt; I have recieved a lot of notices on poaching and stealing<br>
people etc. since day one.<br>
arkducky&gt; I am fully against poaching.<br>
arkducky&gt; Stealing is another issue. People have their own decision on<br>
where he/she decides to go.<br>
arkducky&gt; I will review the reports on a case-by-case basis.<br>
Toila&gt; could you give the actual description of poaching ark?<br>
arkducky&gt; Going into other colonies and placing a message to attempt to<br>
get members to move to another colony.<br>
arkducky&gt; Avoid posting on city boards as well.<br>
arkducky&gt; I will allow simple messages that you are looking for staff on<br>
the colonly message board but don't get carried away.<br>
toxic_rebel&gt; no questions about the low-density plan, but I do wonder<br>
when the new houses will be available, they were promised for the<br>
beginning of januari<br>
arkducky&gt; The houses have been submitted to Hawk for his final<br>
decision.<br>
arkducky&gt; He has been extremely busy and he will get to them as soon<br>
as he humanly can. :)<br>
Toila&gt; could you post a list of acceptable places to advertise?<br>
arkducky&gt; The colony message board and employment office<br>
HolodocDR&gt; About the low density plan regarding double jobs. Often this<br>
does compromise performance when we talk about colony jobs. A BL<br>
who can handle more than one block should probably be an ND. Maybe<br>
some redefining is needed. Like ltd BDs and NDs<br>
arkducky&gt; If it effects your performance and no action is taken on your<br>
part, I will step in and you may not like the decision. I expect everyone to<br>
take responsibility for your actions :)<br>
HolodocDR&gt; Let's be frank we have about 3-7 blocks while other hoods<br>
have 30 in CT<br>
arkducky&gt; That is true, but we are still in launch phase.<br>
arkducky&gt; Our goal is to provide the most content possible in Cybertown.<br>
In my opinion, we have already provided more than most colonies.<br>
arkducky&gt; I know seven has an update on security.<br>
arkducky&gt; I will let her give that now. :)<br>
Borg7_of_9&gt; Notice for all: Hi-Tek Security has recently been renamed<br>
&quot;Hi-Tek Colony Defense Team&quot; but we will still be providing the same<br>
high level of protection as before!<br>
arkducky&gt; Seven and her team should be thanked for all the great work<br>
they do in making our colony safe!<br>
Borg7_of_9&gt; of course I will answer any questions regarding safety and<br>
protection in Hi-Tek<br>
Borg7_of_9&gt; thank you ark!<br>
arkducky&gt; I don't see any questions..<br>
arkducky&gt; Thank you for the update seven.<br>
arkducky&gt; :)<br>
Borg7_of_9&gt; yvw!<br>
arkducky&gt; Is there anything else?<br>
arkducky&gt; If not, I thank everyone for their attendance and patience.<br>
This meeting is now adjourned! :)</font></p>
