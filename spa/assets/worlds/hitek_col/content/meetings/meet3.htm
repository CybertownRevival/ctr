[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : Well, I will quickly brief on the Concourse 
&quot;C&quot; hoods... <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : I have a list of applicants that have passed 
the initial stage of becomming a neighborhood leader in Hi-Tek <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : Those applicants are currently receiving a 
background check and further questions will be sent those those who passed stage 
2 <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : to those* <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : I would like to congradulate those who have 
been hired as Concourse &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; neighborhood leaders! The colony is growing 
strong and I, personally, look forward to the future! <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : Any brief questions? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : ok thank you ark :) <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : to proceed :) <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : Are the Nl apps just for concourse C? <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : NL <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : Yes <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : And they will be closed again? <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : Yes <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : ok <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Some announcements now: <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : We will proceed through the same process 
until all neighborhood leaders have been hired <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : test <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : 1..2..3.. <br>
[Colony_Deputy] White_Archangel [11436] : failed <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Intelli-Tek is in the process of a theme scope 
expansion and will be renamed <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : those interested in Intelli-Tek should be even 
more interested in the new one <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : so i doubt there will be a problem in that 
regard <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : We are also seeking a CERB Representative <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : you can apply by clicking Services on Hi-Tek 
Todaya <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and then clicking the link provided to the app
<br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Also - Dec. 22 is the deadline for an Honored 
Title <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : you must apply by that date <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : You may apply if your Immigration date is Jan 
3 or earlier <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : if this is the case, and you apply by the 
22nd, you will be considered for presentation to the council and the founder to 
receive an honored title <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : And now, the big announcment <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : A massive change in colony policy <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Saiyanz2000 [3041] : Hey <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : that is already being enforced <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Hi-Tek is now operating on a low-density 
population plan <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : which means, we allow less people per city 
block <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : which means we can support more blocks, and 
thus provide more content to increase the tangible value of the colony and 
cybertown.com <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : The plan works as follows: <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Neighborhoods should have between 150-200 
citizens <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : blocks should have a target population of 
25-30 <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : these population caps may be lifted or changed 
in the future <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : After Jan 1st, we will allow residents to hold 
more than one job in a neighborhood <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : BLs may lead more than one block <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : NDs may simply lead blocks rather than a BL
<br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : BDs may work in multiple blocks <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : but not in other colonies <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : This will also allow us to operate under a 
lower population <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and continue to expand physically <br>
[Colony Deputy] arkducky [23030] : And we expect everyone to not abuse this 
policy and maintain good work habits <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : Are there any questions/concerns with this new 
policy? <br>
[Outlands Deputy] Undercore [10895] : Sounds great! <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : very good :) <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : Interesting <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : More info about our new method of operation 
will be available soon on a webpage <br>
[Gallery Chief] Handsome109 [8064] : Very nice :) <br>
[Outlands Deputy] Undercore [10895] : It'll be a new and original way of 
working, can't wait hehe <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : We may have more &quot;country roads&quot; in our colony
<br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : but our hoods will definitely be more closely 
knit <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : I like that idea! <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : * question pls* <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : sure Azuri :) <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : Ty <br>
[Colony_Deputy] White_Archangel [11436] : *was getting used to having 2 
neighbors* <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : Would you explain &quot;Country Roads&quot; <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : i mean, a block might have as low as 2-5 
people in it <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : with possibly no staff <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and woudl be run by staff living in other 
blocks <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : the block would exist and operate normally 
however, and would provide portalnet content <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Saiyanz2000 [3041] : this is already in effect correct? if 
it isnt when is it going to start? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : it is in effect <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Saiyanz2000 [3041] : thx <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : some hoods have fuller blocks that were filled 
before this policy was created <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and as free spaces open, they will be closed, 
to bring those block populations down to their target <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : when all hoods are open with 4-5 blocks each, 
we will start opening more blocks in all hoods <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and then raise the hood population cap <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : and/or block population caps <br>
[Elder] Jeremy12 [9017] : :) <br>
[Elder] Jeremy12 [9017] : nice to see you in person :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : we are still in a launch phase and are at this 
point, just getting all of our hoods open <br>
[Elder] Jeremy12 [9017] : hey zoundite :) <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : hi Jeremy :) <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : *another question, pls* <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : fire away :) <br>
[Colony_Deputy] Toila [4701] : Colony meeting in progress... <br>
[Sponsor Team Member] zoundite [23308] : Hey there Jeremy :o) <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : How will you determine which blocks will only have a 
pop of 2-5? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : i wont <br>
[Elder] Jeremy12 [9017] : ohh, I apologize... <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : citizens will <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : it may come to the point where no one is 
around to move in to a new block <br>
[Neighborhood Deputy] Saiyanz2000 [3041] : like staff citizens or citizens will 
inform the staff? <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : the blocks with 2-5 would be allowed to grow 
to 25-30 <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : i just mean that we may have many blocks in 
the future with a very low population <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : *nods* <br>
[Templar] Azuri [15987] : ty <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : np <br>
[Colony Leader] Halogen [26891] : any other updates? <br>
