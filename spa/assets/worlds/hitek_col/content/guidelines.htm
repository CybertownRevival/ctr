&nbsp;</p>
    <li>The guidelines of Hi-Tek inherit the guidelines of the Cybertown 
    Constitution, Founders Guidelines, City Guidelines, Unified Ban Policy, and 
    Leaders Code of Ethics. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Any houses with objectionable or explicit content will be removed 
    immediately along with an explanation sent to the homeowner. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Each resident is to treat another resident with respect and dignity at 
    all times. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Residents who will be away for long periods of time and who would be at 
    risk for deletion should put an away tag at the beginning of their house 
    name. (Ex: {AWAY} My House) Houses with away tags will not be deleted until 
    the last access date is more than 6 months old. Residents who will be away 
    more than six months should notify their NL and request a waiver. </li>

  <ol type="A">
    <p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <li>No employee of Hi-Tek may hold more than one position within Hi-Tek 
    without consent from the Colony Leader. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Employees of Hi-Tek are allowed and encouraged to expand their 
    boundaries from the colony by holding positions in City Areas.&nbsp; Hi-Tek 
    proudly allows their residents to work freely in other public city areas. It 
    is the worker's responsibility to accept jobs based on their time allowance 
    and will be permitted to hold as many city jobs as they want as long as they 
    continue to perform optimally in Hi-Tek. Be careful not to take on too many 
    responsibilities, as it may impair your performance and prevent promotions.
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>No Hi-Tek employee may be employed in another colony without consent. 
    Those found in violation will be removed from duty immediately. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The colony should host a city-wide event every quarter. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The Colony Leader or a CD proxy is required to address the residents of 
    their colony each month, updating them of the state of the colony. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Poaching of any form, in any place, and by any medium in Cybertown or 
    any other online community is strictly prohibited. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>No one may change content on public boards, the configuration of 
    customizable neighborhood content, nor the look and feel of a neighborhood 
    or block without permission from the Colony Leader, Commanding Officer or 
    the Chief Content Officer. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Employees may be removed from duty without warning if found performing 
    the following acts:
    <ol type="1">

      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Harassing a fellow worker by threats, nagging, or being disrespectful
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Failing to answer inquiries from a co-worker in need <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Providing false information to anyone in Cybertown relating to your 
      work <br>
      <br>

&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Getting banned or disciplined by Security <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Damaging the image or reputation of any part of Hi-Tek with malicious 
      intent </li>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Employees of ND rank or lower who are banned for one week or less may 
    resume work when they return with consent of the NL. If the ban is any 
    longer, than one week, the employee will be removed from duty and if is in 
    good standing upon return, may resume duty by filling out the proper job 
    forms. The NL or supervisor must agree to their return. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Employees of NL or higher may be demoted or removed from duty for any 
    kind of ban or disciplinary action. If a hearing is in order, or the nature 
    of the ban is in dispute and is being heard from CERB, the employee may 
    remain on duty as long as work quality is not weakened.&nbsp; The workers may be 
    put into a probationary form of employment. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Rather than a complete removal from duty, probationary employment can be 
    instituted if an employee is suspected of wrongdoing. Only the Chief of 
    Security, Colony Commander, or Colony Leader may approve an activation of 
    probationary employment. An employee in probationary employment cannot be 
    promoted or may not work on special projects or have access to restricted 
    internal information. The employee may have access rights removed as well or 
    may have all tools removed until the situation is resolved. </li>

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">
  <ol type="A">
    <p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <li>These guidelines are designed to enable Hi-Tek to operate with minimal 
    staff and residents while still providing content and maintaining high 
    tangible value.&nbsp; They are subject to change. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Neighborhood Population Target
    <ul type="square">
      <p><br>

    <li>Block/Neighborhood Ratio
    <ul type="square">

    <p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Hi-Tek employs a CD who is the Chief of Security. They will liaise with 
    Cybertown Security and will periodically inform the Colony Leader of any 
    threats to the City or the Colony. The Security Officer may propose an 
    emergency change in Colony Operation in the event of a Security Emergency. 
    The CL must approve of the change prior to its activiation.
    <ul type="square">
      <p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <li>OpCon 1 is a normal Operating Condition. All employees will have 
      normal access, message boards will remain in normal operating condition.
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>OpCon 2 is a precautionary Operating Condition. When in effect, some 
      message boards will have their HTML posting functionality deactivated. All 
      boards will be backed up. CDs will perform increased security sweeps 
      through the colony. They will place heavy emphasis on specifically 
      threatened areas of the colony. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>OpCon 3 is an emergency Operating Condition. When in effect, all HTML 
      functionality will be disabled. All events, contests, and meetings may be 
      postponed until the situation is resolved. Access Rights may be removed 
      from threatened areas of the Colony or all of the Colony. Only the Colony 
      Staff would have Access Rights in those areas. Extremely threatened areas 
      may have deputy tools removed until the situation has been resolved. 
      Colony Staff will do daily sweeps of the colony to assess its condition. 
      OpCon 3 will most likely be in effect in small, localized areas of the 
      colony. Drills may be performed quarterly and at random times in some 
      neighborhoods.&nbsp; The Staff will always be notified beforehand, and drills 
      will take place during off-peak hours. A drill consists of changing board 
      settings and access rights settings in a very timely manner. </li>
    </ul>
    </font>
    <p><br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The criteria for setting the OpCon levels are as follows:
    <font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <ul type="square">
      <p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <li>OpCon 1: Guarded condition - No major threats. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>OpCon 2: Recent hack or vandalism attack in the city, or meriting 
      citywide security advisories from the Cybertown Dept. of Security. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>OpCon 3: Severe alert from Cybertown Security or other officials, or 
      most likely a specified threat to Hi-Tek or a portion of it, or following 
      an attack upon Hi-Tek. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>An OpCon indicator will be placed on the message board and Colony 
    Offices, and link colors across the colony will change to enhance 
    recognition of the state of alert. </li>
