      <h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>
      We want Cybertown Revival to remain a pleasant and safe place for all citizens. With this aim in mind, please familiarize yourself with Cybertown Revival's Rules and Regulations. Upon creating an account, you acknowledge you will follow and accept all of the Rules and Regulations.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>1. HARASSMENT</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Harassment is any persistent, uninvited contact that is creating alarm, annoyance, or distress or duress.</p> 
      <br />
      <h3>Examples of harassment</h3>
      <p>* Messaging users repeatedly when they ask you to stop, or they cease responding to you.</p>

      <p>* Repeated and unwelcome social invitations.</p>
      <p>* Using the "@" function to repeatedly spam users.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Please note that developers are busy and prefer not to be unnecessarily distracted, so direct tagging is only to be done as a last resort. The majority of users on Discord should never have to tag the developers. Please speak to the appropriate representatives in #General channel and always be as polite as possible. We're all humans, after all.</p>

      <br />
      <p>When multiple people with security privileges are present when a potential warning or ban is being considered, involving as many of these people in the decision as possible is encouraged, as this will increase the likelihood of reaching an objective and fair outcome for all.</p>
