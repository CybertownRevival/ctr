      <h2 class="my-3">What We Do</h2>

      <p>Cybertown Revival (CTR) is a community-run fan project created to restore and preserve Cybertown,
        within the era before paid membership was introduced.</p>

      <h2 class="my-3">How We Do It</h2>

      <p class="mb-2">By bringing together the communities knowledge, skills and memories, we have been able
        to
        restore
        Cybertown to it's former glory. We have collected a large repository of graphics, web pages and
        other archived files from across the internet to help support the restoration of Cybertown.</p>

      <p>Anyone with any level of web programming or VRML experience can easily contribute to the project. We
        also welcome and encourage those who have memories of different features to share those memories and
        participate in our growing restoration.</p>

      <h2 class="my-3">Why We Do It</h2>

      <p class="mb-2">We feel that Cybertown was an important part of the internet of the 90s/00s, and was
        the
        earliest look
        at what we thought would be the future of virtual reality and virtual worlds. Cybertown was certainly
        ahead of it's time in many ways in that respect.</p>

      <p>We aim to allow citizens both old and new to visit and enjoy Cybertown just as it was before, and to
        share happy memories both new and old.</p>

      <h2 class="my-3">Guidelines for Upgrades</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">While the intention of Cybertown Revival is to keep the platform as original as
        possible,
        there are
        some occasions where an upgrade or change my be required. An upgrade is defined as a change to the
        platform which deviates from the original mechanics of Cybertown (before paid subscription).</p>

      <p class="mb-2">Upgrades may be considered for the following reasons:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Security - ensuring data, users and the platform is secure from exploits and hacks</li>
        <li>Privacy - providing users with ways to choose what data is shared online about themselves</li>
        <li>Safety - up-to-date, modern tools to handle abuse and safety concerns.</li>
        <li>Maintainability - Streamlining and/or automating processes to reduce the amount of manual
          interaction to keep the platform running.</li>
        <li>Compatibility - ensuring compatibility with popular modern-day browsers</li>
        <li>Accessibility - providing support for accessibility tools such as screen readers.</li>
      </ul>
