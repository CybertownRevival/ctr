Sci-fi: Slow, neighborhood map missing, temp.wrl missing, no other erros
Entertainment: Weirdly different from sci-fi despite similar models.
Games: Weird lighting issues, same as prod.
Virtual Worlds: Billboard weirdly blue, unlike prod. spec_color.js broken? Fixed spec_color.js
Cyberhood: No obvious issues
Inner Realms: No obvious issues.
The Campus: X_ITE 10 seems brighter. More working lights? Headlights?
Adventure: Color changes on edge of vision. This appears to be prod behavior.
Hi-Tek: Prod needs fixes. Currently getting weirdly... network-blocked in 10. Prod has errors with files but doesn't completely die.
9th Dimension: Visual differences, mostly look lighting related.
The Plaza: Seems fine.
Employment office: Seems fine
Flea market: Fails due to incorrect IS statements outside PROTOs. Needed fixes to script S (which is probably unused anyway)
The Mall: Lighting issues same in both. Orange ceilings weirdly bright in 10. Prod matches Win98 Blaxxun. Elevators not working in 10. Shared events failing in both. Some fixes to bxx_auth.js help, but more fixes are needed for elevator to work.
